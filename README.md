# D&D Trading Program

## Description
The **D&D Trading Program** is a Python-based trading utility designed to enhance the gameplay of Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. This program allows players to simulate dynamic trade systems with fluctuating prices, adjustable modifiers, and customizable items and islands.

This script and program is a work in progress. It is my first script, so there will be bugs at times. Currently, the basis of this program is for my DnD Pirate campaign that I run. Although it says that this is a D&D trading program, it can be used for any system that you like that uses some kind of money. In the final version (whenever that is), I hope it will be cleaner and display more as a TTRPG trading program.

Whether youâ€™re a Dungeon Master looking to add depth to your world or a player managing a trading business, this program provides all the tools to create an engaging trading experience.

## Features
- **Customizable Islands**: Define unique islands with specific items and prices.
- **Dynamic Price Fluctuations**: Simulate real-world trading with randomized price adjustments.
- **Global and Local Modifiers**: Adjust global and item-specific modifiers to create varied trading scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using `Tkinter`, the GUI is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Save and Load Configurations**: Save your custom settings and reload them anytime.
